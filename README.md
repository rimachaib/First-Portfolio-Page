# first-portfolio-page
A simple web page written in HTML and CSS. This web page was a requirement for the final assignment within Thinkful's Flex Engineering Program lesson titled "HTML and CSS fundamentals".  The page contains a baisc layout that includes an Introduction, About Me, and Contact section.  Creating this web page allowed me to apply conceptual knowlege gained from the Thinkful curriculum to build my first personal web page.
